README

a makefile is included:

- If you want to make use of the makefile to easily compile code:
  1. please transfer the makefile over to the VM
  2. run command 'yum install make' 
  3. after installed, if *.pc files and makefile are in the same directory, run command "make pn" where n is the part number (1,2,3,4)
  4. and then run command './pn' to execute, where n is the part number (1,2,3,4)

- otherwise, compile steps as normal (found in example code).
